# Self-Driving-Car-Traffic-Sign-Classification
This is the second project in the first term of the Self Driving Car Nanodegree course offered by Udacity.

In this project German traffic signs are classified with deep learning convolutional neural networks. Used the popular LeNet architecture with three convolution and two fully connected layers, max pooling to sub sample, and relu for activation function. Implemented this LeNet model with TensorFlow and Python and trained it on Windows dual-core CPU machine.

The Python code and the images used in this project are enclosed.
